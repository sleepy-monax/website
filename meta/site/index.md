I am a software engineer and I love building things like operating systems, compilers, tools, and web engines. This site is my tiny universe it's full of my thoughts, ideas, and stuff I made with my friends.

## Projects

This is all the stuff I made or contributed to:

 - [skiftOS](https://github.com/skift-org/skift) : A hobby operating system built from scratch for ARM, x86, and RISC-V architectures. It is designed to be simple, modern, and modular, featuring a modern C++ core library, reactive UI, and a capability-based microkernel.
 - [Vaev](https://github.com/skift-org/skift/tree/main/src/web) : A lightning-fast, lightweight, and secure HTML/CSS engine built for effortless document generation and streamlined web browsing.
 - [Paper Muncher](https://github.com/odoo/paper-muncher) : An experimental document generation tool currently in its early stages.
 - [BRUTAL](https://github.com/brutal-org/brutal) : An operating system inspired by brutalist design that combines the ideals of UNIX from the 1970s with modern technology and engineering.
 - [CuteKit](https://github.com/cute-engineering/cutekit) : The ✨ magical ✨ build system and package manager
 - [Cat](https://cute-engineering.github.io/cat/) : A tiny static site generator.

## Friends

My friends are also building cool stuff, in no particular order:

 - [Lou !](https://habert.me/portfolio) - She is building a [discord clone](https://disclone.carbonlab.dev/) for some reason.
