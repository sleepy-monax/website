# Expressing Myself

In recent months, something changed—something changed in me. Before, I was focused on proving myself, building bigger, building better, and building more. The "self" in me didn't really exist; I was only defining myself by what I was doing or building, and nothing more. I wasn’t really making art or expressing myself or my feelings. My being was defined by what I made. I was just trying to prove myself to the world. But now, I need something new. I need to express, I need to connect with myself, and show that to the world.

I hope this garden will help me with that.
