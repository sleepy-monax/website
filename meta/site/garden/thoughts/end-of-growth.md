# The end of growth

I fear the end of my growth as a person
I've seen some adults who stop growing 
When things die they stop growing; when I stop growing I will die

But not today, I have been growing a lot lately, I have been more political, more engaged with the world, and have been expressing myself more and more. This feels good
